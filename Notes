# Bugs to fix
    - Goals page - 'Something went wrong' error on first load. Fine after refresh. 
    - Dashboard sankey diagram - seeing a mismatch between sum of income streams and 'Income' node.
    - Category dropdown in 'Spending Trends' widget - sort and group
    - Budget page - 6 month history should include current month being looked at
    - Budget page - something going wrong with the history chart when changing from this month to last month. Numbers all wrong.
